## Refactor Tractor Group Project

### Turing Mod 2 Final Solo Project
### [Kathryn Jackson](https://github.com/kathrynljackson)


## Abstract

For this independent project, the task was to create a travel agency site that allows users to sign in and view their travel data. Users can also choose from a list of desitnations and add a new trip to their dashboard. The main goal was to complete at least three iterations according to the [rubric specicifactions](https://frontend.turing.io/projects/travel-tracker.html). We were required to test each class in terms of both their default properties and methods. This project also required collaboration, as we were instructed to send at least two pull requests to an assigned partner.

## Project Goals

* Use OOP to drive the design of the application and the code
* Work with an API to send and receive data
* Solidify the code review process
* Create a robust test suite that thoroughly tests all functionality of a client-side application

## Technology Requirements

* the fetch API to retrieve and add data
* Sass for getting fancy with your CSS
* Mocha and Chai for testing your code

## Installation

1. Clone down [this repo](https://github.com/kathrynljackson/travel-tracker-kj).  

2. You can use an optional argument when you run git clone and rename your local repository: 

```git clone https://github.com/kathrynljackson/travel-tracker-kj.git <what you want to name the repo>```

3. Then install the library dependencies. Switch into your new directory.

4. Run `npm install` in the terminal.

5. To verify that it is setup correctly, run `npm start` in your terminal. Go to [`http://localhost:8080/`](http://localhost:8080/) in the browser to visit the deployed application.
